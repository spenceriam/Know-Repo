The simplest way for freelancers and agencies to share GitHub project progress with non-technical clients and stakeholders.

---

## The Problem

Developers live in GitHub. Clients and non-technical stakeholders do not. This leads to friction: developers manually copying/pasting issue updates into emails and project management tools, and clients struggling to report bugs or track progress without being forced to sign up for a tool they don't understand.

## The Solution

**Know-Repo** provides a secure, dead-simple, read-only portal for your clients. An admin (you) can select a GitHub repository and generate a unique, shareable link. Your client can use this link to view a clean list of open issues and submit new ones directly to your repository, all without needing a GitHub account.

## ‚ú® Core Features (MVP)

* **Secure Admin Auth:** Admins authenticate securely using their existing GitHub account.
* **Repo Selection:** Quickly select any of your private or public repositories to create a shareable portal.
* **Frictionless Guest Access:** Guests access the portal via a secure magic link sent to their email. No GitHub account or password is required.
* **Simple Issue Viewing:** Guests see a clean, simplified list of all **open** issues in the repository.
* **Direct Issue Creation:** Guests can create new issues through a simple form, which land directly in your GitHub repo, perfectly formatted.
